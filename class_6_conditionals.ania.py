Exercise

Write some code that prints “This is odd” if the user inputs an odd number.
(Hint: use an if statement)
Example:
User input: 7
This is odd

# We can use modulus to figure out odd or even
# val = 6
# result = val % 2
# print(result)

Exercise
Add to your previous code so it prints “This is odd” if the user enters an odd number, and “This is even” if the user enters an even number.
(Hint: add an elif statement)

Examples:
User input: 7
This is odd

User input: 12
